# Learn about endpoint analytics
Endpoint analytics help provide insights into how well your organization works and the quality of the experience you deliver to end users. To help improve user productivity and reduce IT support costs, endpoint analytics can:

* Help identify configuration or hardware issues that slow down devices.
* Provide recommended actions to remediate these issues.
* Proactively make changes without disrupting end users or generating help desk tickets.

Endpoint analytics are part of the [Microsoft Adoption Score](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/adoption/adoption-score). The Adoption Score provides productivity data, insights, and recommendations for your end users' experience and your organization's overall technology experience.
