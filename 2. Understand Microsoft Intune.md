# Understand Microsoft Intune
Microsoft Intune provides cloud-based mobile device management (MDM), cloud-based mobile application management (MAM), and cloud-based computer management for your organization. Microsoft Intune helps you protect your organization by controlling features and settings on Android, Android Enterprise, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, and Windows 10/11 devices.

Microsoft Intune integrates closely with:
* Microsoft Entra ID for identity and access control.
* Microsoft Purview Information Protection.
* Microsoft Defender advanced threat protection products.

When you use Intune with **Microsoft 365**, users can work from any device, and you can still control securityâ€”like blocking copy-paste from company data to personal apps. If your company still uses older systems like on-premises Exchange email servers or Active Directory, you can use special tools called **Intune connectors** to connect everything together.

Intune comes as part of a bundle called [Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) suite](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security), which is a set of Microsoft security tools.
